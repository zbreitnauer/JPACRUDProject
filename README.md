#Lessons Learned
In this project, I learned how to manipulate mySQL databases using a web interface.
The most important lesson I learned was how to create a database using MySQL Workbench and how to create, update, and delete items from said database using JPA. Things I need to work on are better understanding of syntax from mySQL and just how DAO and Controllers work. Still boggles my mind. Other than that it was pretty cool to make my own database.
